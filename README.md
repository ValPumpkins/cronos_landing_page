# 💡 Introducing Cronos

Welcome to the landing page of our CronOS project

Cronos is our end-of-first-year portfolio and aims to simplify the management of crons in order to open up this great functionality to a public unfamiliar with this automated tasks system

This page presents the main features of our product (the website and the client application), the birth of the project and the team behind Cronos, as well as a few reviews from satisfied customers

<br>

# 🔎 Features

💨 A **responsive page** that simply but effectively presents the product and what it can do for you

💻 *Features section ???*

💿 A **App section** : a very important part of our project. Indeed, it's what links our website dashboard with the user's system. Without it, crons cannot be implemented !

👫 An **About section** introducing the two team members behind the project and the story behind its creation

⭐️ A **Reviews section** featuring opinions from satisfied customers
